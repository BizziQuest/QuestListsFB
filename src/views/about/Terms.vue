        <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>
          To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will the Operator, its affiliates, directors,
          officers, employees, agents, suppliers or licensors be liable to any person for any indirect, incidental,
          special, punitive, cover or consequential damages (including, without limitation, damages for lost profits,
          revenue, sales, goodwill, use of content, impact on business, business interruption, loss of anticipated
          savings, loss of business opportunity) however caused, under any theory of liability, including, without
          limitation, contract, tort, warranty, breach of statutory duty, negligence or otherwise, even if the liable
          party has been advised as to the possibility of such damages or could have foreseen such damages. To the
          maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the aggregate liability of the Operator and its affiliates,
          officers, employees, agents, suppliers and licensors relating to the services will be limited to an amount
          greater of one dollar or any amounts actually paid in cash by you to the Operator for the prior one month
          period prior to the first event or occurrence giving rise to such liability. The limitations and exclusions
          also apply if this remedy does not fully compensate you for any losses or fails of its essential purpose.

        <h2>Indemnification</h2>
        <p>
          You agree to indemnify and hold the Operator and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,

          only to the extent that they do not violate any applicable laws and are intended to be limited to the extent
          necessary so that they will not render this Agreement illegal, invalid or unenforceable. If any provision or
          portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by a court of
          competent jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that the remaining provisions or portions thereof
          shall constitute their agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof, and all such remaining provisions
          or portions thereof shall remain in full force and effect.

          conflicts or choice of law and, to the extent applicable, the laws of United States. The exclusive
          jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter hereof shall be the courts located in
          Maryland, United States, and you hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. You hereby waive
          any right to a jury trial in any proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement. The United Nations
          Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.
